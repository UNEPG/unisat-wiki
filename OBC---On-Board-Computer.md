The on-board computer (hereafter referred to as the OBC) is an integral part of the spacecraft, also the main computing unit of the UniSat. The main load falls on the OBC, and all nodes and subsystems must be controlled, executed algorithms embedded in the On-board computer. In the purpose of education usage, the on-board computer must also perform the functions of an interactive reference document or book, development environment and communication center for the other subsystems.

In addition to those, On board computer (OBC) is the major brain of the satellite, responsible for all core functions, like collecting the system data, logging, error handling, data monitoring, and etc.

Here on the OBC, we have two cameras on OBC, one as a general RPi camera that responsible for capturing beautiful space images while the other is responsible for video recordings.

The capturing task (both imaging and video recording) is a software designed task that runs among almost all the satellite life time in a cycled period.
